project-roulette
================

Have troubles with choosing what work on today?
Too many options, too little time... sounds familiar.

Make a shot!

```bash
npm install
npm start

Go to [your browser](http://localhost:3000/) and fill the list of the projects
you want to continue working on, and make a shot :)
